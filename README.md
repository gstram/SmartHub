# SmartHub
This is a personal project I started in Summer 2016 to get some experience programming with Android Studio. Most of the code is written in Java. Project was inspired by a smart mirror I saw on the internet. 

Smart Hub that can be used to display information from many sources on a single screen. Currently it can get data from Google Maps and Forecast.IO. After pulling the project, you need to change the apiKey and googleMapsAPI variables in the main method to your own key from Google Maps and Forecast.IO to get it to work. 

Project is still a work in progress and I work on it sporadically. Some features I want to add in the future include: 
Stock information
News Information
Better weather icons
Email Notifications
Different Profiles for more than one user
Better code because code is sloppy
